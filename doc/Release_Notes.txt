Known Issues
------------

Below is the list of known issues in this release of
Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks (Intel(R) TBB).
See the "Known Issues" appendix in the Intel(R) TBB Developer
Reference for notes applicable to multiple releases of Intel(R) TBB.

Library Issues

    - If you build Intel(R) TBB from sources with GCC 6, specify
        the -flifetime-dse=1 option to prevent crashes at runtime,
        or use Intel(R) TBB makefiles that automatically set this option.
