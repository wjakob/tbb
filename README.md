This is git repository is currently based on TBB 2019 Update 6 and will be
updated from time to time to track the most recent release. The only
modification is the addition of a CMake-based build system.

This is convenient for other projects that use CMake and TBB because TBB can be
easily incorporated into their build process using git submodules and a simple
``add_subdirectory`` command.

Currently, the CMake-based build can create shared and static versions of
`libtbb`, `libtbbmalloc` and `libtbbmalloc_proxy` for the Intel `i386` and
`x86_64` architectures on Windows (Visual Studio, MinGW), MacOS (Clang) and
Linux (GCC & Clang). The `armv7` and `armv8` architectures are supported on
Linux (GCC & Clang). Other combinations may work but have not been tested.

See index.html for general directions and documentation regarding TBB.

See examples/index.html for runnable examples and directions.

See http://threadingbuildingblocks.org for full documentation
and software information.

The CMake build contains the following additional/changed files that are not
part of the regular release: ``build/mingw_cross_toolchain.cmake``,
``build/version_string.ver.in``, ``.gitignore`` (modified), ``README.md`` (this
file), and ``Makefile.old`` (renamed from ``Makefile``).
